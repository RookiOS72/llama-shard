- Confirmed Ollama has no native multi-machine sharding, but llama.cpp
  (the engine underneath it) has an RPC backend (`GGML_RPC`) that does
  cross-machine layer splitting. Decided to try it as "step 1" before
  considering anything bigger.
- Set up SSH key-based access from `exo01` to `exo02` (`brenden@192.168.1.39`)
  to make working across both machines practical.
- Checked Homebrew's `llama.cpp` formula: it does **not** set `GGML_RPC` or
  `GGML_METAL` explicitly, relying on upstream defaults. Confirmed upstream
  defaults are `GGML_METAL_DEFAULT=ON` on Apple platforms (good) but
  `GGML_RPC` defaults to `OFF` — so the Homebrew bottle would **not** have
  RPC support. Building from source instead.
- Installed `cmake` via Homebrew on both machines (neither had it).
- Cloned `llama.cpp` (shallow, `--depth 1`) into `~/dev/llama.cpp` on both
  machines.
- Configured the build with `-DGGML_RPC=ON -DGGML_METAL=ON
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release` on both. Notable output on both machines:
  ```
  -- Metal framework found
  -- Including METAL backend
  -- Using RPC backend
  --   RDMA transport enabled (Apple RDMA-over-Thunderbolt, UC)
  -- Including RPC backend
  ```
  The RDMA-over-Thunderbolt line is a good sign — if these two Macs are
  ever connected via Thunderbolt, the RPC backend can use that instead of
  Wi-Fi/Ethernet for node-to-node traffic, which should help throughput a
  lot given how much a plain network hop hurt exo's MLX pipeline earlier
  this session.
- Build started on both machines (background). Next: once built, start
  `rpc-server` on exo02, point `llama-server`/`llama-cli` at it from
  exo01 with `--rpc`, load a real GGUF model split across both, and
  benchmark actual tok/s against what we saw with exo/MLX.
